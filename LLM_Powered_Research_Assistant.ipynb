        "In today's competitive and rapidly evolving technological landscape, research and development teams are often overwhelmed by the volume of new scientific publications. Manually reviewing, summarizing, and extracting key insights from these documents is time-consuming and can delay critical innovation decisions. To address this challenge, a technology consulting firm is building an LLM-powered assistant designed to streamline the literature review process. This AI assistant will automatically extract summaries, metadata, and emerging trends from collections of research papers, significantly reducing manual effort and accelerating the discovery of relevant information. By applying this solution to a curated dataset of recent publications, the firm aims to demonstrate how advanced language models can enhance productivity and support timely, data-driven innovation across research-intensive domains."
